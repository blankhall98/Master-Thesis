This section will give an overview of the project structure.
The project consists of 4 directories and 1 executable python file. These are described bellow:
1. run.py : This executable python file runs the entire model and is enables the user to replicate all the results shown in the written work.
2. /written_work : This directory contains the written work and the different versions/updates that may become available in the future.
3. /literature : This directory contains literature that has been referenced in the written work, with the purpose of facilitate the reader to complement its understanding of the work.
4. /scripts : This directory contains all the complementary code files that are used to run the model. The user may modify the scripts to adapt the model.
5. /data : This directory contains two sub-directories: raw_data (which contains database downloaded from multiple sources, in its raw shape), and processed_data (which contains the databases modified by scripts in the /scripts directory and are ready to be use).
